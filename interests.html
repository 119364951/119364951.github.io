		<h2>Sports:</h2>
		<p>
		Sports have always been an endearing passion of mine ever since I was a little kid. Never constrained to one discipline of sport I moved
		around a lot trying almost everything when I was young whether that be rowing along the Lee or practicing tennis in the courts of Douglas.
		However, after moving into first year of secondary school I figured I ought to stay and achieve mastery or at least some level of competency
		in a few sports. The two sports I had chosen were the ones that held my interest for the longest time being archery and taekwondo. I was lucky
		to have chosen these as my sports because as I soon found out, I often did not have enough time to dedicate myself to these sports especially
		around the exam years of third year and sixth year. However now that I am in university, I have now found time for these two sports again,
		catching up on lost time. Despite the setbacks I will continue to pursue these sports throughout my university years and hopefully into the future.

		<h2>Travel:</h2>
		<p>
		Travelling was something I did not have an interest in when I was child. For me it was bothersome having to wake up early for some uncomfortable
		plane and then suffer jet lag just to get to another country where the accommodation wasnâ€™t as good as home. However, things began to change 
		I began to talk people of various cultures in my secondary school which opened my eyes to the wonders of diversity. After that revelation I enjoyed
		travelling more often relishing in the variety of people and places in trips abroad, whether that be enjoying the local festivals and trying new
		flavours in exotic dishes. It was truly something else to behold. Now these days I travel when I can often with family and friends in far flung and
		interesting places. I even have begun collecting fridge magnets to post up on my fridge to mark and remember the places where I have been.
