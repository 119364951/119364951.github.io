		<h2>Hyper Automation</h2>
		<hr>
		<img class="image" src="hautomation.jpg">
		<p>
		What is hyper automation? Well as <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2020/">Gartner</a>
		defines, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML),
		to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to
		the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)”  Or to put it simply a mixture of
		automation technology that enchances or augments human capability.
		
		Due to hyper automation's ability to augment human prodction it comes with great <a href="https://www.allerin.com/blog/were-afraid-the-expansion-of-hyper-automation-may-be-a-bad-omen-for-all-physical-process-companies">benefits</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>It can reduces human effort by doing a lot of work in lesser amount of time</li>
			<li>Thus can reduce the risk of human errors as machines are for precision</li>
			<li>Automation can also improve the quality of jobs by eliminating tedious, tiring, and dangerous for humans processes</li>
			<li>This then leads to better productivity and much higher output</li>
		</ul>
		
		But what are the practical downsides? There isn't a lot to say on this due to how new the technology is. But one thing is for certain hyper automation 
		isn't cheap to implement. However the potential returns makes this worthwhile.

		<h2>Multi-Experience</h2>
		<hr>
		<img src="multiex.jpg" alt="multiexperience">
		<p>
		According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/multiexperience-development-platforms-mxdp">Gartner</a> 
		Multi-Experience can be defined as, "Multiexperience refers to the various permutations of modalities(e.g., touch, voice and gesture), 
		devices and apps that users interact with on their digital journey across the various touchpoints." But what does this mean? And what relevance
		does this have for your company's potential? It refers to the various interactions your customers may or will have across multiple platforms
        and devices. This means now these days companies can have an easier time obtaining new customers, provided they can fully harness the power of
		these awesome technologies.
		
		And apart from a boost in clients multi experience development can also <a href="https://codebots.com/app-development/5-reasons-ctos-are-choosing-multiexperience-development-platforms">aid</a> in other things:
		<ul>
			<li>Multi Experience Development can aid in internal opertional efficiencies because it encourages the developers to create systems that are compitable cross platforms, creating smoother connections and higher effinciency</li>
			<li>It can also reduce the security for your data. If you were to check how many programs requires information from you're company you'd be shocked. However multi experience development can streamline this since it is cross platfrom. This means less shraing and more security</li>
			<li>It most importantly multi experience development allows for digital transformation. This is because multi experience development encourages technoligical development on all fronts whether it be from admin systems or customer services, this drive allows the business to transform effieciently and increase it longevity.</li>

		<h2>Distributed Cloud</h2>
		<hr>
		<img src="cloud.jpg" alt="hyper-automation">
		<p>
		Distributed Cloud is having computational, storage, and networking ability in a smaller cloud service located outside the centralized cloud.
		This in turn offers a more flexible and safer option for a company, as they aren't reliant on a singular massive cloud nor do they suffer the costs 
		of on site servers. The decentralisation of the cloud comes with measurable <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2017/2/why-new-apps-boost-the-need-for-distributed-cloud-infrastructure">benefits</a> too:
		<ul>
			<li>The aforementioned resilience too failure is one of its big draw ins</li>
			<li>It's networking scalability is a big advantage. Instead of buying two massive clouds and using some of each, you can instead buy a group for
			smaller clouds you can use to its full potential so everything is pushed for potential</li>
			<li>Distributed clouds are also secure. Since they are spread apart, should a data breach occured then the damage is minimalised.</li>
		</ul>
